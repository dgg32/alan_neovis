# Welcome to Doctor.ai React Front-end

This is the React front-end app for Doctor.ai, our proud submission to the SINGAPORE HEALTHCARE AI DATATHON AND EXPO 2021 (https://www.nus-datathon.com/). In this version, we have used Alan Studio as our frontend and NeoVis.js to display the network visualization. Please refer to our article [Doctor.ai with Alan and Neovis.js](https://dgg32.medium.com/doctor-ai-with-alan-and-neovis-js-aa4ac0d94ba).
